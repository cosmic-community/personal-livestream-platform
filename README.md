## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/bun
- A Cosmic CMS account and bucket
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd personal-livestream-platform

# Install frontend dependencies
bun install

# Install server dependencies
bun run install:server
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```bash
# Cosmic CMS Configuration
COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG=your-bucket-slug-here
COSMIC_READ_KEY=your-cosmic-read-key-here
COSMIC_WRITE_KEY=your-cosmic-write-key-here

# Streaming Server
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3001

# Development
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 3. Start Development Servers

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
bun run dev

# Or start them separately:
bun run dev:client  # Frontend (http://localhost:3000)
bun run dev:server  # Backend (http://localhost:3001)
```

### 4. Access the Application

- **Broadcaster Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **Stream Viewer**: http://localhost:3000/watch
- **Server Health**: http://localhost:3001/health
- **Stream API**: http://localhost:3001/api/streams

## üîß Configuration

### Streaming Server URLs

The client will attempt to connect to streaming servers in this order:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` (from environment)
2. `ws://localhost:3001`
3. `ws://127.0.0.1:3001`
4. `ws://localhost:8080`
5. `ws://127.0.0.1:8080`

If all connections fail, the system automatically enables fallback mode for local testing.

### WebRTC Configuration

The platform uses multiple STUN servers for optimal connectivity:

- Google STUN servers (primary)
- Twilio STUN servers (backup)
- Cloudflare STUN servers (backup)

### Media Constraints

**Webcam Streaming:**
- Resolution: 640x480 to 1920x1080 (ideal: 1280x720)
- Frame Rate: 15-60 FPS (ideal: 30 FPS)
- Audio: Echo cancellation, noise suppression enabled

**Screen Sharing:**
- Resolution: 1280x720 to 3840x2160 (ideal: 1920x1080)
- Frame Rate: 15-60 FPS (ideal: 30 FPS)
- Cursor: Always visible

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend Components

- **BroadcasterDashboard**: Main streaming interface with controls and preview
- **StreamViewer**: Viewer interface for watching live streams
- **StreamControls**: Start/stop streaming and source toggle controls
- **StreamPreview**: Live preview of broadcaster's stream
- **StreamStats**: Real-time statistics and analytics

### Backend Services

- **Socket.IO Server**: Real-time communication and signaling
- **Connection Manager**: Health monitoring and retry logic
- **WebRTC Handler**: Peer connection management
- **Stream Session Manager**: Session tracking and analytics

### Connection Flow

1. **Initialization**: Client connects to Socket.IO server
2. **Health Check**: System tests network and device capabilities
3. **Stream Start**: Broadcaster gets media stream and creates WebRTC offer
4. **Signaling**: Server coordinates WebRTC negotiation between peers
5. **Streaming**: Direct peer-to-peer media transmission
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous health and quality monitoring

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Unable to connect to streaming server"**
- Ensure the Node.js server is running on port 3001
- Check firewall settings
- Try refreshing the page
- The system will automatically enable fallback mode if needed

**"WebRTC not supported"**
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Ensure browser permissions for camera/microphone
- Check if running on HTTPS in production

**"Media access denied"**
- Grant camera/microphone permissions in browser
- Ensure devices are not in use by other applications
- Try different devices if available

### Performance Issues

**High latency or poor quality**
- Check network connection speed
- Close other bandwidth-intensive applications
- Switch to a better network if possible
- The system will automatically adjust quality based on connection

**Frequent disconnections**
- Check network stability
- Ensure consistent power supply
- Try using ethernet instead of WiFi
- Check for browser extensions that might interfere

### System Requirements

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+
- 2 Mbps upload speed for streaming
- 1 Mbps download speed for viewing
- Camera and microphone for broadcasting

**Recommended:**
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- 5 Mbps upload speed for high-quality streaming
- 3 Mbps download speed for viewing
- Hardware-accelerated video encoding support

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Health Dashboard

The system provides real-time monitoring of:

- **Connection Status**: Server connectivity and fallback state
- **Device Status**: Camera, microphone, and screen sharing availability
- **Network Status**: Latency, bandwidth, and server reachability
- **Stream Statistics**: Viewer count, session duration, quality metrics

### API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Server health and status
- `GET /api/streams` - List of active streams
- WebSocket events for real-time updates

## üöÄ Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

```bash
# Build and deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG
# - COSMIC_READ_KEY
# - COSMIC_WRITE_KEY
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL (your production server URL)
```

### Backend (Any Node.js Hosting)

```bash
cd server
npm install --production
npm start

# Environment variables needed:
# - PORT (default: 3001)
# - FRONTEND_URL (your frontend domain)
# - NODE_ENV=production
```

### Production Considerations

- Use HTTPS for both frontend and backend in production
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx) for the backend
- Configure firewall rules for WebSocket connections
