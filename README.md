## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> No content model prompt provided - app built from existing content structure

### Code Generation Prompt

> Build a simple livestreaming web application for personal use. I want to be the only broadcaster. The app should have the following core features: A "Go Live" button that lets me start a livestream using either my webcam or screen share. Toggle buttons to switch webcam and screen sharing on or off. A public viewing page where users can watch the livestream (no login needed). The stream should be live in real time with low latency, ideally using WebRTC or similar. Include basic start/stop stream functionality and a simple UI to show whether I am live. This is a solo use case (no chat, no multi-user broadcasting). Keep the UI and backend as simple as possible.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

const session = await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
  type: 'stream-sessions',
  title: `Stream Session ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
  metadata: {
    start_time: new Date().toISOString(),
    stream_type: 'webcam', // or 'screen'
